- As the `owner of the coffee shop`, ` I want to watch what's going on throughout the day`, `making sure things are running smoothly`

- In the coffee shop, I can see people are getting their coffees and things look generally fine

- `But I can't just sit there and watch things all day long`

- `I would like to eventually leave` and `maybe come back at the end of the day and be able to check in and see how the shop did when I was gone`

-  For example, 
    
    - `I might want to know, how many coffees were sold today ?`

    - `How long was the average wait time for someone when ordering a coffee?`

    - `Did we run out of inventory for anything today?`

    - `Even better yet, I'd love to be able to be automatically alerted if the wait times become too long.`

    - `That way, I can call in another employee or go pitch in myself.`

- `Every business`, `including this coffee shop`, can `use metrics to "measure" "how well systems and processes are running".`

- This idea of 
    
    - `observing systems`

    - `collecting metrics `
    
    - `evaluating those metrics over time`
    
    -  `then using them to make decisions or take actions,` 
    
    is what we call `monitoring`

- `It's important to set up monitoring in the cloud.`

- With the `elastic nature of AWS services` that` dynamically scale up and down`, you'll want to `keep a close pulse on your AWS resources` `to ensure` that `your systems are running as expected`

- For example, `if an EC2 instance is being over-utilized`, you can` trigger a scaling event that automatically would launch another EC2 instance`

- `if an application starts sending error responses at an unusually high rate, you can alert an employee to go take a look at what's going on.`

- `In the next few videos, we will cover a variety of tools that help you monitor your AWS environment`

- `This monitoring will help you measure how your systems are performing`, alert `you when things aren't right`

-  `even help you debug and troubleshoot issues as they come along.`
