- all `computing` based on the `client-server` Model Architecture 

- in the `client-server` model articture the `the client make a request` and the `with permission the server going to respond to that requests`

- this server in `AWS` known as `Amazon Elastic compute cloud i.e Amazon EC2 instance` which is a `vitual server`

- but i can get `more complex application` in case of `real life solution`

- the key concept of `AWS` being `pay for whatever we want to use`

- when we have `on premises dta center` things does not go in that way , we can't triple the `capacity` if we need at a `fingure snap`

- we `don't have to prepay for anything` and does not have to care about the `capacity constrint`
