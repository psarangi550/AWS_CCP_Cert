 # <ins> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) </ins> #

 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable `compute capacity` in the cloud as `Amazon EC2 instances`. 

 - Imagine you are responsible for the architecture of your company's resources and need to support new websites. With traditional on-premises resources, you have to do the following:

    - Spend money upfront to purchase hardware.

    - Wait for the servers to be delivered to you.

    - Install the servers in your physical data center.

    - Make all the necessary configurations.


- By comparison, with an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.

    - You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.

    - You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.

    - You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.

    - You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.


# <ins> How Amazon EC2 works </ins> #

- First, you launch an instance. Begin by selecting a `template` with `basic configurations` for your instance.

- These configurations include the `operating system, application server, or applications`

- You also select the `instance type` and which is the `specific hardware configuration of your instance such as CPU and Memory`

- As you are preparing to `launch an instance`, you specify security `settings to control the network traffic that can flow into and out of your instance`

- Next, connect to the instance

- `Your programs and applications have multiple different methods to connect directly to the instance `and exchange data

- Users can also connect to the instance by `logging in and accessing the computer desktop.`

- After you have connected to the instance, you can begin using it. You can run commands to install software, add storage, copy and organize files, and more.
