-  `Cloud computing `is the `on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet` with `pay-as-you-go` pricing

-  `On-demand` delivery indicates `AWS has the resources you need` when `you need them.` and ` You don't need tell us in advance that you're going to need them`

- Suddenly you find yourself needing `300 virtual servers`. Well, `just a few clicks and launch them`. Or 
- you need `2,000 terabytes of storage`; you don't have to tell us in advance, `just start using the storage you need when you need it.`

- Don't need them anymore, just `as quickly you can return them and stop paying immediately`

- That flexibility is just not possible when you're managing your own data centers

- If there are IT elements that are common across a number of businesses, then this is not a differentiator.
 
- Take a MySQL database as an example. If your business runs a MySQL database, does your ability to install the MySQL engine make you a better company than your competitors? Well, probably not that. 

- Do you keep backups in a way that makes you superior to other players in your vertical? Again, doubtful.

- The data inside your database, now that's critically different. The way you build your tables and manage the structures absolutely separates you from the competition. But the engine is just the engine. 

- At AWS, we call that the `undifferentiated, heavy lifting of IT`. `Tasks that are common, often repetitive, and ultimately time-consuming.` These are the tasks AWS wants to help you with so you can focus on what makes you unique

- Over the Internet seems simple enough, but it implies that you can access those resources using a secure web page console or programmatically , No additional contracts or sales calls are needed.

- You don't staff a shop with employees 24 hours a day at the same levels you do during peak hours

-  Why pay for developer environments, for example, on weekends if your developers aren't working on the weekends?
