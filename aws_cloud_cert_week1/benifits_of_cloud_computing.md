# <ins> Benifits Of cloud Computing </ins> #

- why a company might choose to take a particular cloud computing approach when addressing business needs.

    - Trade upfront expense for variable expense

       - upfront expenses means `data center , physical server or other resourse` tht we need to invest before using them 

       - Not having to invest in technology resources before using them relates to Trade upfront expense for variable expense.

       - `Variable expense` means `only pay for the computing resources that you consume instead of investing heavily in data center or physical server` befotre using those `data center or physical server or other resources`

       - By taking a `cloud computing approach` that offers the `benefit of variable expense`, `companies can implement innovative solutions` while saving on costs.

    - Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers

        - Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers

        - A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.

    - Stop guessing capacity

        - With cloud computing, you donâ€™t have to predict `how much infrastructure capacity` `you will need ` `before deploying an application`

        - Accessing services on-demand to prevent excess or limited capacity relates to Stop guessing capacity.

        - For example, you can `launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed`, and `pay only for the compute time you use`

        - Instead of paying for `unused resources or having to deal with limited capacity`

        -  you can access only the capacity that you need. 
        
        - You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand

    - Benefit from massive economies of scale

        - By using cloud computing, you can achieve a `lower variable cost than you can get on your own`

        - Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers, such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale.

        - The economy of scale translates into lower `pay-as-you-go ` prices.

    - Increase speed and agility

        - The flexibility of cloud computing makes it `easier for you to develop and deploy` applications.

        - This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and innovate.

        - When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparison, cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.

        - `resources can be availale within minutes while using the cloud computing` but `in case of cloud computing on premises it can take longer to get the resources`

    - Go global in minutes

        - The `global footprint of the AWS Cloud` `enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly` providing very `low latency`

        -  This means that even if you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays. 

        - you will explore the AWS global infrastructure in greater detail. You will examine some of the services that you can use to deliver content to customers around the world.

        - Quickly deploying applications to customers and providing them with low latency relates to Go global in minutes.


# NOTE:

    - AWS Lambda is an AWS service that lets you run code without needing to manage or provision servers. 

    - Deploying applications connected to on-premises infrastructure is a sample use case for a hybrid cloud deployment.

    - It is possible to back up files to the cloud, but this response option does not describe cloud computing as a whole.
