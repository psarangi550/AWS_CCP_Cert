- `Relational databases`
    
    - In a `relational database`, `data is stored in a way that relates it to other pieces of data`

    - An example of a `relational database` might be the `coffee shopâ€™s inventory management system`. 
    
    - `Each record in the database would include data for a single item, such as product name, size, price, and so on`

    - `Relational databases` use `structured query language (SQL)` `to store and query data.`

    - `This approach allows data to be stored` in an 
        
        - `easily understandable `
        
        - `consistent` 

        - `scalable way`

    - For example,` the coffee shop owners can write a SQL query` to `identify` all the `customers whose most frequently purchased drink is a medium latte.`


# <ins> Amazon Relational Database Service </ins> #

- `Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)` is a `service` that` enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.`

- `Amazon RDS` is a `managed service` that `automates` tasks such as

    - `hardware provisioning`

    - `database setup`

    - `patching`

    - `backups`

- With these capabilities, you can spend less time completing administrative tasks and more time using data to innovate your applications

-  You can `integrate Amazon RDS with other services` `to fulfill your business and operational needs`

- such as `using AWS Lambda to query your database from a serverless application.`

- Amazon RDS `provides a number of different security options`

    - `Many Amazon RDS database engines offer`

        - `encryption at rest (protecting data while it is stored)`

        - `encryption in transit (protecting data while it is being sent and received).`

- Amazon `RDS is available on six database engines`, which optimize for 
    
    - `memory` 
    
    - `performance`
    
    - `input/output (I/O). `

- The `database engine` are off 

    - `Amazon Aurora`

    - `PostgreSQL`

    - `MySQL`

    - `MariaDB`

    - `Oracle Database`

    - `Microsoft SQL Server`


# <ins> Amazon Aurora </ins> #

- `Amazon Aurora is an enterprise-class relational database.`

- It is `compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases`

- It is `up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases `

-  up to `three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.`

- `Amazon Aurora` helps to `reduce your database costs` by `reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations` while `ensuring that your database resources remain reliable and available`

- `Consider Amazon Aurora if your workloads require high availability`

-  It `replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones`

-  `continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.`
