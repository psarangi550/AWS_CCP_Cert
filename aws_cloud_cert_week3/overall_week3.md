-  You learned about all the `different types of AWS storage mechanisms`

    - **AWS EBS**

        -  The first one we learned about is `elastic block store` volumes i.e `AWS EBS`

        - you `attach those to EC two instances`

        - So you have `local storage` that is not `ephemeral or temporary`

    - **AWS S3**

        - `how` `you` can `store objects` in `AWS` with the` click of a button` or `call of an API.` using `Amazon S3`

    - We even discuss the various relational database options available on AWS

    - **AWS DYNAMODB**

    - for the `workloads that just need a key value pair`. We have the `non relational offering called dynamodb.`

    - **AWS EFS**

        - Next up was EFS for `file storage` rather than a `block storage or object storage`

    - **AWS Redshift**

        - We then have `Amazon Redshift for all our data warehouse needs`

    - **AWS DMS**
        
        - `to aid in migration` of `existing databases`. W`e have DMS or database migration service`

    - We also touched upon the lesser known storage Worried services

        - `AWS document DB`

        - `AWS Neptune DB`

        - `AWS QLDB`

        - `Amazon Managed Blockchain Service`

    - Lastly we talked about how` Caching Solutions` like `Elasticache` ,  in `dynamoDB` `accelerator` can be `used as a "lot of places to store different types of data" `

    -  hopefully you've learned the correct place to store each type.
