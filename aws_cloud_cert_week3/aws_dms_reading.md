# <ins> AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) </ins> #

- `AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)` `enables` you `to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases`, and `other types of data stores.`

- With `AWS DMS`, you `move data between a source database and a target database`

- The `source and target databases can be of the same type or different types`

- `During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database. `

- For example,` suppose that you have a MySQL database` that is `stored on premises` / `in an Amazon EC2 instance` or `in Amazon RDS` , `Consider the MySQL database to be your source database, sing AWS DMS, you could migrate your data to a target database, such as an Amazon Aurora database.`

    - `Enabling developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users`

- Database consolidation

    - `Combining several databases into a single database`

- Continuous replication

    - `Sending ongoing copies of your data` `to other target sources` `instead of doing a one-time migration`
