# <ins> Compliance </ins> #

- `For every industry`, there are ` "specific standards "that "need to be upheld" ` and `you'll be "audited or inspected" to ensure that you have met those standards.`

- For example, `for a coffee shop`, the `health inspector will come by and check that everything is up to code and sanitary`.

- Similarly, you could be `audited for taxes`  `to see that you have run the back office correctly and have followed the law.`

- You `rely on "documentation, records, and inspections to pass audits and compliance checks" as they come along`

- You'll need to `devise` a `similar way` to `meet compliance and auditing in AWS.`

- Depending on `what types of solutions you host on AWS`, you will `need to ensure` that you are `up to compliance for whatever standards and regulations your business` is `specifically held to.`

- `If you run software that deals with consumer data in the EU, you would need to make sure that you are in compliance with GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation)`

- Or `if you run health care applications in the US, you will need to design your architectures to meet HIPAA(Health Insurance Probability and Accountability Act) compliance requirements.`

- `Whatever your compliance need` is, `you'll need some tools` to be `able to collect documents, records, and inspect your AWS environment` `to check` `if` `you meet the compliance regulations that you're under.`

- `The first thing to note is AWS has already built out data center infrastructure and networking, following industry best practices for security and as an AWS customer`

- `you inherit all the best practices of "AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes" `

- `AWS complies with a long list of assurance programs that you can find online.`

- ` This means` that` segments of your compliance` `have` already `been completed` and `you can focus on meeting compliance within your own architectures that you build on top of AWS`

- The `next thing to know in regards to compliance and AWS` is that the `region you choose to operate` out of` might help you meet compliance regulations`

- `If you can only legally store data in the country that that data is from` you can` choose a region that makes sense for you` and` AWS will not automatically replicate data across regions`

-  `You also should be very aware of the fact that you own your data in AWS`

- `As shown in the AWS shared responsibility model you have complete control over the data that you store in AWS.`

- `You can employ multiple different encryption mechanisms to keep your data safe.`

- `That varies from service to service.`

- `If you need` `specific standards for data storage`, `you can devise a way to either reach those requirements by building it yourself on top of AWS`  or `using the features that already exist in many services`

- `For a lot of services enabling data protection` `is a configuration setting on the resource`

- `AWS also offers` `multiple` `"white papers and documents"` that `"you can download and use for compliance reports"`

- Since `you aren't running the data center yourself`, `you can essentially request` that `AWS provides you with documentation proving that they are following best practices for security and compliance. `

- One place you can access these documents is through a service called `AWS Artifact`

- ` With AWS Artifact`, you can `gain access to compliance reports done by third parties who have validated a wide range of compliance standards`

- Check out the `AWS Compliance Center` `in order to find compliance information all in one place`

- It will show you `compliance enabling services`, as well as` documentation like the AWS Risk and Security white paper`,` which you should read to ensure that you understand security and compliance with AWS`

- `To know if you are a compliant in AWS, please remember that we follow a shared responsibility`

- `The underlying platform is secure and AWS can provide documentation on what types of compliance requirements they meet through services like AWS Artifact and white papers.`

- `But beyond that, what you build on AWS is up to you`

- `You control the architecture of your applications and the solutions` you build and `they need to be built with compliance, security, and the shared responsibility model in mind`.
