# <ins> Overall Summary of AWS global infrastructure </ins> #

- `Logical cluster of data center` created the `Availability Zone`

- `Availabity Zone or AZ` creates the `AWS Regions` which been `distributed globally`

- We should `deploy infrastructure` atleast accross `2 availabilty Zones`

- there are few `AWS Regional Service` such as below deployed on `mutiple AZ or avialbility Zone`

    - `AWS ELB`

    - `AWS SNS`

    - `AWS SQS`

- We can use the `Edge location` to `deliver the content from the AWS region` to server the `customer with faster rate of transfer and low latency`

- `Edge devices` such as `AWS Outpost` which allow us to `run the AWS infrastructure i.e AWS mini region handled by AWS in the on premises data center`

- we can provision the `AWS resources and service` using the below option such as 

    - `AWS mnagement console`

    - `AWS CLI`

    - `AWS SDKs`

    - `management tool` such as 

        - `AWS BeanStalk`

        - `AWS cloudformation` where we can run the `infrastructure as code`


- this will help in getting `How globally Avialbility of AWS is ` and `How Easy to Set this up`
