# <ins> High Availablity in AWS </ins> #

- Lets suppose we are running a `coffee shop` and there was a `parades planned` on a `certain date due to successful cloud migration` so there will be `floats and ballons and candy throwing from the street`

- As the `parade` been planned which goes right accross `the coffee shop` which can cause the `problem to the customer who is been coming for coffee` as the `road been blocked` customer driving for to `grab the coffee`

- we ned to think about a solution if the `customer not get to the coffee shop temporaryly`

- we need to make sure `our coffee shop` is `highly available for the customer if in case there were some temporary delay`,  so we can have `multiple coffee chain setup accross all location` so that `customer can roll to any of the coffee center in order to get their coffee` and our `customer and business` will not get affected because of this `coffee shop making the coffee and customer getting their coffee`

- Same goes for the `AWS` as well where we don't have `giant data center in one location with all the resources` but `we have global infrastructure being set up` where `we have multiple global data center on all different region` which can `withstand power outage or natural disaster and fault tolerance `

- we need to make the `AWS Service` as `fault tolerance and highly available` for the `customers`

- `AWS` operate on `all sorts of Area` known as `regions`

- This make the `AWS Services Highly available` without bothering `if one giant datacenter failed then all the center will be down`
