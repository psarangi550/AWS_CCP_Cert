- we have `a lot of coffee operation` thats been going on `in our coffee shop`

- we have the 

    - `elastic`

    - `scalable`

    - `disaster resistance`

    - `cost optimized`

`architecture` that now `global and highly secured network ` which can be `deployed entirely programmatically `

- in order to `show appreciation` to the `loyal coffee customer` we can start a `frequent coffee drinker loyalty program`

- we can hand over the `frequent drinker loyalty card` in the `form of punch card` but we can't track those `punch cards` and use them to know our `customer well`

- hence we need to deliver `frequent drinker loyalty card` in the form of `digital card` in order to ` keep track the customer to know the customer base well` such as 

    - what they order 

    - How much they purchased 

- this info that we got from the `frequent drinker loyalty card ` will help the customer `get the best reward they earned by buying coffee frequently`

- this also help the `business` to `keep track of customer base well and to know the customer `

- in order to store the `info that we got from the frequent drinker loyalty program about the customer` we need `databases` and `storage` to store the `information`

- we need to make sure we have the `correct database` to store the `frequent drinker loyalty program about the customer Task` and `correct storage` to store the `correct data type`

- it can be differ `many data type of data solution for which many type of db can be used` and many type of `storage` for `many data type`

- this is known as the `data Solution` and AWS provide Services for the `data solution`
