# <ins> Comparing Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB </ins> #

- welcome back to that` championship chase of the database`

    - In the `relational corner` 
        
        - engineer to `remove undifferentiated heavy lifting from your database administrators`
        
        -  with `automatic high availability and recovery provided`

        - `you means customer control the data`

        - `you means customer  control the schema`

        - `you means customer  control the network`

        - `You means customer are running Amazon RDS.`

    
    - In the `NoSQL` corner

        - using a `key-value pair` that `requires no advanced schema`

        - able to `operate as like global database` at `the touch of a button`

        - it has `massive throughput or frequency`

        - it has `petabyte-scale potential`

        - it has `granular API access`

        -  `It is Amazon DynamoDB`

- Each `database class` is `engineered to exactly enhance the exciting existential environments you envision.`

- `Once again, the winner will depend on your use case`

    - Round 1

        - `Relational databases` `have been around` `since the moment businesses started using computers`

        - Being `able to build complex analysis of data spread across multiple tables` is the `strength of any relational system`

        - `In this round`, you have a `sale supply chain management system` that you have to `analyze for weak spots`

        - Using `RDS` is the `clear winner` here `because it's built for business analytics.`

        - Because you need `complex relational joins` `Round 1 easily goes to RDS`.

    
    - Round 2 :-

        -  the use case. Pretty much anything else

        - what your `standalone legacy database vendor` `would have you believe`, `most of what people use expensive relational databases for has nothing to do with complex relationships`

        - `a lot of what people put into these databases ends up just being lookup tables`

        - For this round, imagine you have an employee contact list

            - `names`

            - `phone numbers`

            - `emails`

            - `employee IDs`

        - Well, `this is all single table territory.`

        - `I could use a relational database for this`

        - `the things that make relational databases great, all of that complex functionality`

        - creates `overhead` and `lag` and `expense` if `you're not actually using it`

        - `This is where non-relational databases, DynamoDB, delivers the knockout punch`

        -  By `eliminating all the overhead `, `DynamoDB allows you to build powerful, incredibly fast databases where you don't need complex join functionality`

        - Dynamo DB comes out the undisputed champion


- ` Once again, the winner depends on your individual workload`

- `Each service is the right service for specific needs and once you understand what you need you will know again, which service is your champion.`
